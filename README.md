# Capacity Digital Twin
This project implements a capacity simulation engine combining Monte Carlo, Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and a small Machine Learning PoC to explore operational bottlenecks in complex service systems.

The public version contains the core simulation logic and reproducible tooling.
Several commercial modules, dashboards and configurations have been removed.

Used Kaggle dataset "jaderz/hospital-beds-management" under license CC0 for demonstration data.
